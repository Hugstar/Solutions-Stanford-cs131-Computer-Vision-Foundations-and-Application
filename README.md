# CS131: Computer Vision Foundations and Applications
This repository contains my solutions for assignments of the fall 2017 iteration of [CS 131](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs131_fall1718/), a course at Stanford taught by [Juan Carlos Niebles](http://www.niebles.net) and [Ranjay Krishna](http://ranjaykrishna.com).

The assignments cover a wide range of topics in computer vision and should expose students to a broad range of concepts and applications.
